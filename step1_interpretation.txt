INTERPRETATION GUIDE: Step 1 - Explore OASIS Data
====================================================

This guide helps you understand what the results from step1_explore_data.ipynb mean.

WHAT THIS NOTEBOOK DOES:
------------------------
This notebook explores the OASIS-1 dataset structure, loads metadata, and visualizes brain scans.

KEY OUTPUTS TO UNDERSTAND:
--------------------------

1. Subject Count
   - Shows how many brain scans you have
   - Example: "Total subjects found: 75"
   - This tells you your dataset size

2. Metadata Columns
   - ID: Subject identifier (e.g., OAS1_0001)
   - Age: Person's age in years
   - M/F: Gender (Male/Female)
   - MMSE: Cognitive test score (0-30, higher = better)
   - CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating (0 = healthy, >0 = dementia)
   - eTIV: Estimated total intracranial volume
   - nWBV: Normalized whole brain volume

3. Diagnosis Distribution Plot
   - Shows how many subjects are in each group
   - If you see "Diagnosis column not found", that's okay - we'll create it in Step 2 using CDR scores

4. Age Distribution Plot
   - Histogram showing age range of subjects
   - Helps you understand if age might be a factor

5. MMSE Distribution Plot
   - Shows cognitive test scores
   - Lower scores often indicate dementia
   - Normal range: 24-30
   - Dementia range: <24

6. Brain Scan Visualizations
   - Three views: Axial (top-down), Sagittal (side), Coronal (front)
   - These show the actual brain structure
   - Gray areas = brain tissue
   - Darker areas = cerebrospinal fluid or ventricles
   - Multiple slices show how the brain looks at different depths

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
-----------------
- Are there roughly equal numbers of Demented and Nondemented subjects? (Important for balanced ML)
- What's the age range? (Older subjects might have more brain changes)
- Are MMSE scores different between groups? (Should be lower for Demented)
- Do the brain scans look different visually? (You might see more dark spaces in Demented brains = brain shrinkage)

COMMON QUESTIONS:
-----------------
Q: Why do some subjects have missing data (NaN)?
A: Not all subjects completed all tests. This is normal in medical datasets.

Q: What if I see errors loading scans?
A: Make sure nibabel is installed and the .hdr files are in the RAW subdirectory.

Q: The brain images look different - is that normal?
A: Yes! Each person's brain is unique. We'll look for patterns across many subjects.

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
After running this notebook, you should have:
- A good understanding of your dataset
- Visualizations saved as PNG files
- Ready to move to Step 2 (compare and extract features)
